When you run this code it first ask's for you to choose an option between 
1 and 5. Where:
- 1: Add Student
- 2: Add Teacher
- 3: Create Workshop
- 4: Add A Skill.
- 5: Add a skill to Student.

Then after choosing  1 or 2 it will ask you for first name and last name.
The Workshop asks you for the subject and the teacher name.
